# Payroll_Application
Created a Database Driven Payroll Java SE Application. Environment: Windows 7, Java, Eclipse IDE, MySQL, JDBC. Installed MySQL database, 
and executed SQL script to create tables. Created a simple java application with a graphical user interface to add different kinds of employees
(salaried, commission based, salaried plus commission, hourly). Enhanced the application to allow the user to perform predefined 
SQL queries selected from the JComboBox or defined in the JTextArea. Added a database update feature e.g. increase base salary 
by 10% for all base-plus-commission employees.
